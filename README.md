# dojpdf
Repository for SQL pdf files for DOJ EOIR

This was a soft attempt at creating a Python script to better handle XML and PDF files involved in DOJ contracts. It was unsuccessful, but I did attempt with libraries such as pdfquery and etree.

I will probably not need to return to it, as the Tabula tool proved much more reliable for this purpose.
